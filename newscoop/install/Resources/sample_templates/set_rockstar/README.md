The clean, modern magazine look. Bold colours, simple navigation and emphasised social and embedded media functions make this theme perfect for lifestyle sites, in-depth magazine portals or organisations who have a focus on the portability and virality of their stories. As ever, images, videos and maps come to the fore, while the new community features in Newscoop 4 exist as standard.

Features include:

    Adaptive CSS resizes for any browser
    Drag and drop front page article reordering
    Five image renditions
    Front page dynamic map shows all article locations
    User profile screens and activity feed
    Sleek readable section and article pages
    Sidebar for embeddable audio and video media
