Copyright: 2009-2011 Flowplayer Oy <info@flowplayer.org>
License: GPL-3
 The Flowplayer Free version is released under the
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (GPL).
 .
 The GPL requires that you not remove the Flowplayer copyright notices
 from the user interface. See section 5.d below.
 .
 Commercial licenses are available. The commercial player version
 does not require any Flowplayer notices or texts and also provides
 some additional features.
 .
 ========================================================================
 .
 ADDITIONAL TERM per GPL Section 7
 If you convey this program (or any modifications of it) and assume
 contractual liability for the program to recipients of it, you agree
 to indemnify Flowplayer, Ltd. for any liability that those contractual
 assumptions impose on Flowplayer, Ltd.
 .
 Except as expressly provided herein, no trademark rights are granted in
 any trademarks of Flowplayer, Ltd. Licensees are granted a limited,
 non-exclusive right to use the mark Flowplayer and the Flowplayer logos
 in connection with unmodified copies of the Program and the copyright
 notices required by section 5.d of the GPL license. For the purposes
 of this limited trademark license grant, customizing the Flowplayer
 by skinning, scripting, or including PlugIns provided by Flowplayer, Ltd.
 is not considered modifying the Program.
 .
 Licensees that do modify the Program, taking advantage of the open-source
 license, may not use the Flowplayer mark or Flowplayer logos and must
 change the fullscreen notice (and the non-fullscreen notice, if that
 option is enabled), the copyright notice in the dialog box, and the
 notice on the Canvas as follows:
 .
 the full screen (and non-fullscreen equivalent, if activated) notice
 should read: "Based on Flowplayer source code"; in the context menu
 (right-click menu), the link to "About Flowplayer free version #.#.#"
 can remain. The copyright notice can remain, but must be supplemented with
 an additional notice, stating that the licensee modified the Flowplayer. 
 A suitable notice might read "Flowplayer Source code modified by ModOrg 2009";
 for the canvas, the notice should read "Based on Flowplayer source code".
 In addition, licensees that modify the Program must give the modified
 Program a new name that is not confusingly similar to Flowplayer and
 may not distribute it under the name Flowplayer.
 .
